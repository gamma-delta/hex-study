I want the levels to be very large, like the sand area in NaissanceE.
Finding the exit should feel like trekking across the land.

So, levels should be more like Caves of Qud or Solar Robot, and less like Nethack.

To generate their villages, they use "Djikstra maps."

Wave Function looks very interesting, especially the version where you give it an example...
i could imagine very interesting things happening if the player can help decide the
example, by editing the world somehow...

A hybrid approach might be interesting.
Some sort of perlin function produces different patches in the world:
this area has buildings, this area has ruins ...
and places a WFC "seed" in the center. So the "buildings seed" or the "ruins seed".
Then WFC iterates.
